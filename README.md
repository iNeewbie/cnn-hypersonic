This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can predict the temperature and pressure countours around supersonic airfoils in a range of mach numbers and angles of attack. The CNN is based on the paper "Prediction of Aerodynamic Flow Fields Using Convolutional Neural Networks" by Bhatnagar et al. (2019).
